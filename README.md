# Portfolio challenge 

Made for challege 3 of the Front-end Web Dev Bootcamp, this builds on my earlier portfolio layout [Digital Folio-01] (https://codeswitchstudio.github.io/digital-folio-01/) using the [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework and applying learnings from Exercises on customizing the css.


## Description

This is a portfolio of work meant to showcase my skills and talents to clients or employers who need a front-end developer with a background in graphic design.

Except for the first project card which is the first version of this portfolio, I created all the content at different periods in my learning journey prior to the bootcamp. As the bootcamp course progresses and more projects are deployed, I will have more to showcase my strongest works as well as the thought processes behind it. 



## Usage

This is made for web browsers on Desktops or laptops but is also responsive.

## Deployment

Other tools used:

[CSS gradient] (https://cssgradient.io) I found this after realising you could just use this instead of a slow loading image which was probably generated from the same kind of tool.
